# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### What is the difference betweenÂ getElementById, getElementsByClassName, and querySelector / querySelectorAll?

* The key differences between `getElementById`, `getElementsByClassName`, and `querySelector/querySelectorAll` 

* `getElementById()` selects a single element based on it's unique `id` attribute.

* `getElementsByClassName` is used for selecting multiple elements by class name when a live HTMLCollection is desired.

* `querySelector/querySelectorAll` used for more complex selections using __CSS__ selectors, expecially when a static collection (NodeList) is preferred. 
 `querySelector` for the first match and `querySelectorAll` for all matches.
